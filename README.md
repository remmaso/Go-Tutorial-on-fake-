## Build a fake API in GO language and put it in a docker container 

## First, you need to create a basic Go program that will serve as your fake API. Here is an example of a simple "Hello, World!" API in Go:

## Next, you need to create a Dockerfile that will build a Docker image for your Go program. Here is an example Dockerfile:

## Once you have created the Dockerfile, you can build the Docker image by running the following command in the same directory as the Dockerfile:

## Finally, you can create a docker-compose.yml file to run the Docker container. Here is an example docker-compose.yml file:

## To run the fake API in a Docker container, run the following command in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file:


RUN :
docker-compose up
